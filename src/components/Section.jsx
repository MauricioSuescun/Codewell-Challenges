        <p>
          The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
          companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not
          just development, but in every aspect of any business.
        </p>
        <p>
          l&apos;m proud to announce that I am now working at one of the
          world&apos;s largest communities teaching young minds about how to
          sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
          opportunities.

        <p>
          As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
          that&apos;s holding you back is yourself.
        </p>
        <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
        <p>
          &quot;How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn&apos;t
          fail?&quot; You&apos;ve already gone through the hardest parts being a
          developer, it&apos;s time to elevate your skills and become a leader
          in something you&apos;re passionate about.
        </p>
        <p>
          l&apos;m happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
          company.
